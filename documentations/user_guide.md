## Dashboard

When you have logged in, you will automatically be redirected to the dashboard page. The Navbar located at the top of the page allows you to have quick access to our Expense Tracker (_Transactions_), Delivery Tracker (_Deliveries_) and ShipTogether (_ShipTogether_) features.

> ***NOTE:*** You can return to the dashboard page from anywhere in our webapp by clicking on _ShopBud_ in the Navbar.  

On the top right hand corner, there is a bell icon (<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625122258/screenshots/bell_hsa1ns.svg" width=15 />) which opens up a drop-down panel where you can see all your important notifications which you may have missed. There is also a User icon (<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625122150/screenshots/user_nm4sny.svg" width=15 />) with your username displayed where you can access the settings page, report page or log out.

The main functionality of the dashboard is to provide users with a clean and simplified view of all their activities within the app. It is sectioned off into 3 parts for each of the main feature of our app.

The _Expenses_ card shows a doughnut chart generated from all expense entered in our expense tracker. It also features a breakdown of all your expenses by stores.

<p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625126044/screenshots/expenses_dashboard_io8uly.png" width=400 alt="expenses card" /></p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625129816/screenshots/shiptogether_dashboard_xvnibg.png" width=75% alt="shiptogether card" /></p>

> ***NOTE:*** An alternative method of accessing the different features is to click on the headers of the corresponding cards.

## Features

### Expense Tracker

In the _Transaction_ page, you will be greeted with the same doughnut chart shown on the dashboard on the left half of the page. On the other half, you will find the detailed breakdown of all your expenses with information such as the item bought, date of purchase, platform at which the purchase was made and the price of the item purchase. You can sort the table according to the relevant fields by clicking on the header (for e.g if you want to sort by price, simply click on the table header _Price_). Clicking multiple times on the same header will alternate between ascending and descending order.

<p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625131403/screenshots/detailed_expenses_ct3ihn.png" width=75% alt="detailed expenses" /></p>

To add a new transaction, simply click on the plus icon (<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625134855/screenshots/plus-square_ysbpdg.svg" width=15 />). Key in the relevant details in the form that pops out and click on add item.

<p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625134118/screenshots/add_item_mzzelr.png" width=40% alt="add new entry" /></p>

If you made any mistakes when entering the details, you can click on the edit icon (<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625134855/screenshots/edit_aftw6e.svg" width=15 />) to change any of the details. Once you have done editing, clicking on the check icon (<img src='https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625142006/screenshots/checkbox-line_iisybu.svg' />) will save any changes made while clicking on the cross icon (<img src='https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625142200/screenshots/x-square_gd45ox.svg' />) will cancel the edit action. You can also delete any entry by clicking on the trash bin icon (<img src='https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625142315/screenshots/trash-2_gqlokf.svg' />)

Any changes made (i.e adding new item, editing items or deleting items) will trigger an update on the doughnut chart, with the _Total Spendings_ also being recalculated.

### Delivery Tracker

When you click on the _Deliveries_ link in the navbar, you will be redirected the the Delivery Tracker page. The item name, tracking number, courier, current delivery status and latest date-time updated of all deliveries currently being tracked by the user will be presented in a clear table format, providing users only with the most relevant and important information. The table can also be easily sorted according to certain fields by clicking on the relevant headers to be sorted by. Clicking multiple times on the same header will alternate between ascending and descending order.

<p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625144182/screenshots/delivery_table_alqab9.png" width=75% alt="delivery table" /></p>

To add a new delivery to be tracked, simply click on the plus icon (<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625134855/screenshots/plus-square_ysbpdg.svg" width=15 />). A form will appear prompting you to key in the item name, tracking number and a drop-down menu, where you can select the courier service your package is using. Once you have confirmed the details, just click on the *Add* button and it will be saved as a new entry.

> ***NOTE:*** As much as we would love to let users input any couriers they like, there are some restrictions due to certain limitations linked to the API we are using. The options that we have made available are tested and verified by us. We have chosen some of the more popular couriers that are widely used locally (Singapore) but if there are any courier that we are unaware of and you think we should add them do let us know! If possible do provide us with the tracking number as well so we can test whether our API actually supports it before integrating it in our app.

<p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625145254/screenshots/add_delivery_glbhbf.png" width=40% alt="add delivery" /></p>

You can delete an entry by simply clicking on the trash bin icon (<img src='https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625142315/screenshots/trash-2_gqlokf.svg' />).

If you would like to see a more detailed breakdown of your delivery, you can enter your tracking number in the search bar below the table and click on the _Track_ button. This will display the step by step delivery route took by your parcel in a format that most official courier package tracking app will also likely provide. If you would wish to view the detailed breakdown of another order, click on the _Track another order_ link at the bottom and input a new tracking number. However, do note that this feature will **only work after you have added a valid entry as described above.**

<p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625146058/screenshots/detailed_delivery_ro9jos.png" width=55% alt="detailed delivery tracking" /></p>

### ShipTogether

**What is ShipTogether?**

ShipTogether is a group buy/order feature, where users can form groups with other users that are purchasing items from the same store/platform so that shipping fees can be kept at a minimum.

**ShipTogether: Main Page**

When you click on the _ShipTogether_ link in the navbar, you will be directed to the ShipTogether page. In this page you will be shown a table with 2 tabs: _Groups_ and _My Groups_. The Groups tab will show the user a list of all the available groups that they can join. Only groups that are **unlocked** will be displayed here. Users can also utilize the search bar to search for suitable groups using either the group name, platform or location. Each group will have their Group name, Store of interest, Meetup Location/Mailing information (if the owner is willing to mail out to members), a estimated shipping price per person in the group currently and whether there is free shipping available with minimum spending displayed to the user.

My Groups tab will show the user all the groups that he have created or joined. For this tab, only the group names will be visible to the user.

<p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625155899/screenshots/group_tab_enh7or.png" width=75% alt="groups tab" /></p>

If users do not find any suitable groups to join, they can create their own group by clicking on the plus icon (<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625134855/screenshots/plus-square_ysbpdg.svg" width=15 />). A form will pop out prompting user to enter relevant details about the new group.

Elaboration on some of the fields in the form:

* Meeting location/Mailing method
  * For most users, we believe that it is more convenient to setup a meetup location where it is convenient for you as a owner to pass the items ordered to the other members of the group.
  * However, if you do no mind to mail out to the members, you could also indicate a mailing method to let potential members know of this option.
* Contact Number
  * This is for ease of communication between members and owner after the group has been locked and the owner is about to place the bulk order.
  * Contact Number will only be show once the group has been locked for security reasons.
* Base Shipping Fee and Free Shipping Min
  * For these 2 fields do only input the numerical price i.e only input 5.99 **NOT** $5.99
  * _Free shipping min_ refers to the minimum price that is required to be hit for free shipping that is available in some store. If this is not available for your store of choice simply put 0 for this field.

The following image will show you what a valid form should look like:

<p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625157186/screenshots/create_new_group_form_wuzefc.png" width=50% alt="create new group form" /></p>

___

**ShipTogether: Groups**

Users can enter and view any group by clicking on the group they wish the view/join. They will be redirected to the group's main page. In this page, users will be able to find relevant information on the group such as the store the group is ordering from, location of meetup, the current estimated shipping fee per member and the amount to free shipping (if available). Users will also be able to see who else are in the group and what others are buying from the store.

<p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625203092/screenshots/group_main_page_jrza7f.png" width=75% alt="group info" /></p>

**Adding items to be purchased**

If you are the a member of the group, you can add items by clicking on the plus icon (<img src='https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625134855/screenshots/plus-square_ysbpdg.svg' />) which will appear on the top right of the card labelled *Items*. A form will pop out where you can input the relevant details of the item you would wish to order from the shop of interest. After which, click on *Add item_* and it will be displayed on the table. A valid input will look something like this:

<p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625204960/screenshots/add_item_form_wnqshs.png" width=40% alt="add item form" /></p>

Once a valid item has been added, the amount to free shipping (if available) and shipping fee per member will be automatically recalculated. If the total amount is still not enough for free shipping, then the amount to free shipping will reflect how much is still needed after the new item is added. However if the free shipping amount has been hit, then both the shipping fee per member and the amount the free shipping will show $0.00.

Users also have the option to delete items that they added by clicking on the trash bin icon (<img src='https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625142315/screenshots/trash-2_gqlokf.svg' />).
> ***NOTE:*** Users are only allowed to delete items that they have added and will not be able to modify other members' entries.

Additionally, all members of the group can access the item link by clicking on the item name. Doing so will redirect users to the item product page on the store itself.

**Discuss with Disqus**

Each group has its own Disqus section, where members of the group can discuss and send updates if necessary. Before leaving a comment on Disqus, users are required to login using the social icons or if you wish to comment as a guest you can tap on the input box labelled _Name_ and then checking the "I'd rather post as a guest" option. You can then start writing comments by clicking on the Text box available and then posting it by clicking on the send button.

<p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625210354/screenshots/disqus_qo2rcs.png" width=75% alt="disqus" /></p>

**ACTIONS YOU CAN PERFORM AS A MEMBER OF THE GROUP**

**Joining the group**

If you are not the owner of the group and you wish to join the group, simply click on the user-plus icon (<img src='https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625203554/screenshots/user-plus_pra4qb.svg' />) on the top right hand corner of the page. Simply enter your contact number and hit join to successfully join the group. By joining the group, the shipping fee per member will automatically be recalculated, which splits the shipping cost further for additional members. Once you have joined the group, you will be able to start adding items by following the steps mentioned in *Adding items to be purchased*.

**Leaving the group**

If you wish to leave the group, click on the door-open icon (<img src='https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625205489/screenshots/door-open-fill_qi1por.svg' />). Do note that by leaving the group, **any items you have added will be deleted from the group**.

Leaving the group will also cause the shipping fee per member and amount to free shipping (if available) to be updated to reflect the changes.

**ACTIONS YOU CAN PERFORM AS THE OWNER OF THE GROUP**

**Locking the group**

As the owner of the group, once you ready to proceed with the bulk order (for e.g free shipping amount has been reached) you can lock the group by clicking on the lock icon (<img src='https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625206912/screenshots/lock_cjgrvf.svg' />). Locking the group prevents anyone else from joining the group by removing it from the *Groups* tab in the ShipTogether main page. Additionally, members will not be allowed to modify the items. After the group has been locked, everyone in the group will be redirected to the locked page of the group where more specific details regarding delivery information and proof of purchase can be seen. After the group is lock, the owner proceeds to collect payments and buy the items listed in the table.

**Deleting the group**

The owner of the group also can decide to delete the entire group if he/she wish to do so by clicking on the trash bin icon (<img src='https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625142315/screenshots/trash-2_gqlokf.svg' />). Doing so will cause all members to be kicked out of the group and the group will no longer be visible in the *Groups* tab in the ShipTogether main page.

___
**ShipTogether: Locked Group**

After the owner locks the group, clicking on the group from the dashboard or my group tab will lead the users to the locked group page. Most of the editing done on this page is only available to the owner of the group since the owner will have to update the order details once order has been placed.

**AS A OWNER**

If you are the owner of the group, this will be the interface that you will be presented with:

<p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625210951/screenshots/owner_view_ozvzz3.png" width=75% alt="owner_view" /></p>

You can also see a simplified instruction on the page itself by clicking on the info icon (<img src='https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625212216/screenshots/info_qizjp1.svg' />) next to the group name.

* **Paid checker**

As the owner of the group, it is your responsibility to collect payments from the members of your group or agree on a payment method before purchasing the items. To make your life as the owner easier, we have given you access to the contact information of all members for ease of communication. Once members have paid for their items you can click on the _Paid_ checkbox to indicate that the member has paid you for his/her order. This serves as a reminder for owners as to who has paid/not paid for their items and a way for members to see the progress of the purchase process.

<p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625212110/screenshots/paid_checker_zsne8d.png" width=75% alt="paid_checker" /></p>

* **Edit order details**

Once all members have paid up and you have placed the order, you are required to update the order details section to input relevant details such as the tracking number, courier used for item delivery and also the meetup date and address so that members will know where to collect their items.

You can edit these information by clicking on the pencil icon (<img src='https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625212216/screenshots/info_qizjp1.svg' />). A pop out form will appear and you can edit the information as you wish.

* **Upload of proof of purchase**

As the owner of the group, you are also expected to upload a screenshot of the order receipt to serve as a proof that a order has indeed been made. You can upload the screenshot by pressing on the upload icon (<img src='https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625212828/screenshots/upload_lmi2x5.svg' />) in the *Order Details* card.

* **Miscellaneous actions**

If a member requests to add additional items after you have locked the group, you can unlock the group again by clicking on the unlock icon (<img src='https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625213145/screenshots/unlock_x9xkd1.svg' />).

If there are any urgent updates that you wish to notify the members about, you can click on the message icon (<img src='https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625213265/screenshots/message-line_lb3wbr.svg' />). A text area will pop out where you can type any message you want. Once you click on the send button, all members will receive a notification in the ShopBud app.

Once you have passed all the items to the members, you can choose to delete the group by clicking on the trash bin icon (<img src='https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625142315/screenshots/trash-2_gqlokf.svg' />).

**AS A MEMBER**

If you are the member of the group, this will be the interface that you will be presented with:

<p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgfzlpuds/image/upload/v1625225625/screenshots/member_interface_hmmpdg.png" width=75% alt="member interface" /></p>

As a member of the group, the group locked page serve as a unified view of all the updates that you will need as the owner proceeds with the bulk order. You can check who has paid for their item by looking at the _Paid_ column under the _Items_ table. Once every member of the group has paid for their order, the owner will proceed with the purchase and the _Order Details_ will be updated with the relevant delivery information and meetup instructions. The owner will also upload a screenshot of the purchase to prove that an order has actually been made.

Additionally, for ease of communication, members will only have access to the contact number of the owner. If you have any urgent issues, please contact the owner directly. Should there be any issues, head over to the report page to let us know.

**Disqus**

Each locked group also comes with their own Disqus section where the members can post any questions they have to the owner or can generally be used to communicate with other members in the group.
